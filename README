# node-epaper
A node.js library for epaper displays using spi.
Tested on Beaglebone.

Check the examples folder to see the usage!

## Things to keep in mind
Keep the SPI cables short
Try lower clock speeds in case of failure


##TODO
Initialize pins (enable spi pins, set EN/BUSY pins)
Generate image from text
Implement algorithm to convert image to epd
Currently only supports MpicoSys TC-P74-110_v1.1. Test and add support for other displays.
