# node-epaper
A node.js library for epaper displays using spi.
Tested on Beaglebone.

Check the examples folder to see the usage!

## Things to keep in mind
Keep the SPI cables short
Try lower clock speeds in case of failure


##TODO
Before each command, set enable, check isbusy, run command, set disable
Url2screen: take a screen shot and push it on screen
Add support for other screen sizes of MpicoSys. Currently only TC-P74-110_v1.1 supported
Configurable pins: right now hardcoded P8.10 and P9.12 are used.
