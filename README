# node-epaper
A node.js library for epaper displays using spi.
Tested on Beaglebone.

Check the examples folder to see the usage!

## Things to keep in mind
Keep the SPI cables short
Try lower clock speeds in case of failure

## Dependencies
Loading screenshot of url functionality is done using wkhtmltoimage and it needs
xvfb to be installed since wkhtmltoimage binary in the
debian repository does not support headless execution.
It will probably be fixed in the next version. wkhtmltoimage tool is provided in
wkhtmltopdf package.

    sudo apt-get install wkhtmltoimage
    sudo apt-get install xvfb


##TODO
Url2screen: take a screen shot and push it on screen
Add support for other screen sizes of MpicoSys. Currently only TC-P74-110_v1.1 supported
Configurable pins: right now hardcoded P8.10 and P9.12 are used.
